        <h1>The Black Cobra</h1>
        <p>The king cobra—one of the most venomous snakes on the planet—can literally "stand up" and look a full-grown person in the eye. When confronted, they can lift up to a third of its body off the ground and still move forward to attack. King cobras can reach 18 feet in length, making them the longest of all venomous snakes. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The species is native to Africa</li>
            <li>Go to Democratic Republic of Congo</li>
            <li>Go to Central Congolian lowland forests</li>
            <li>We can find the black cobras in the mid forest under trees and underground</li>
        </ol>
