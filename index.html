        <h3> Playing badminton is my favourite activity</h3>
            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
            Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" and "doubles".
            It acts as <b>everyday physical activity</b> which helps in <b>gaining fitness and focus</b>.
